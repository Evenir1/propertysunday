# Technology Stack and Template Selection: PropertySunday.com

## 1. Overview

Based on the application architecture designed in `/home/ubuntu/application_architecture.md` and the available development templates, the following technology stack and templates have been selected for PropertySunday.com.

## 2. Frontend

*   **Technology:** Next.js with React and Tailwind CSS.
    *   *Reasoning:* Aligns with the architecture document and the user-provided PDF ("Property Sunday Code Base and colour pallette .pdf") which mentions Next.js. Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which are beneficial for SEO and performance. React offers a powerful component-based UI library, and Tailwind CSS facilitates rapid UI development.
*   **Template:** `create_nextjs_app`
    *   *Reasoning:* This template is designed for advanced frontend applications and includes features like Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, Lucide icons, and Recharts, which can be leveraged for building a modern user interface. It also supports Cloudflare Workers functionality, which might be useful for future scaling or edge functions, though not immediately required for the MVP.

## 3. Backend

*   **Technology:** Python with Flask.
    *   *Reasoning:* Aligns with the architecture document. Flask is a lightweight, flexible, and robust framework suitable for building the REST APIs required for user authentication, listing management, API integrations, payment processing, and ad management. Python's extensive libraries will be beneficial for integrating with external property APIs (PrivateProperty.com, Property24.com) and potentially for web scraping if direct API access is limited.
*   **Template:** `create_flask_app`
    *   *Reasoning:* This template is specifically designed for applications requiring backend and database functionality. It provides a good starting structure including a virtual environment, organization for models and routes, and guidance for MySQL database integration using SQLAlchemy.

## 4. Database

*   **Technology:** MySQL.
    *   *Reasoning:* The `create_flask_app` template provides guidance and configuration examples for MySQL. MySQL is a mature, widely-used relational database system capable of handling the structured data requirements for property listings, user accounts, and transactional data.

## 5. API Integration Module

*   **Technology:** Python (as part of the Flask backend).
    *   *Reasoning:* This module will be developed within the Flask backend. Python libraries such as `requests` (for HTTP calls to external APIs) and potentially `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` (if web scraping becomes necessary for data acquisition from property portals) will be used. Scheduled tasks for data fetching will be managed using tools like Celery (as outlined in the architecture) or simpler cron jobs for the MVP.

## 6. Development Approach

The project will involve creating two primary applications:

1.  A **Next.js application** for the frontend (using `create_nextjs_app`).
2.  A **Flask application** for the backend API and data processing (using `create_flask_app`).

These two applications will communicate via RESTful APIs. The Next.js frontend will consume APIs exposed by the Flask backend.

This selection ensures that we leverage appropriate tools for each part of the application, aligning with best practices and the project's specific requirements for a rich user interface, robust backend logic, database interaction, and external API integrations.
