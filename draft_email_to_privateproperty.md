Subject: Inquiry regarding Data Feed for Property Listings - PropertySunday.com

Dear PrivateProperty.com Team,

My name is [Your Name/Company Name], and we are developing a new property portal for the South African market called PropertySunday.com.

We aim to provide a comprehensive property search experience for our users, and as part of this, we are very interested in the possibility of integrating property listings from PrivateProperty.com into our platform. Specifically, we are looking for a data feed or API that would allow us to *pull* your property listings (including details such as price, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, images, descriptions, etc.) for display on PropertySunday.com.

Could you please let us know if such a data feed or API is available for third-party integration? If so, we would be grateful if you could provide us with any relevant documentation, access requirements, terms of use, and any associated costs.

Our goal is to enhance the property search options available to South African consumers, and we believe that a partnership could be mutually beneficial.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name/Company Name]
